## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Language:** **Java**
- **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** - A modern architectural pattern for separating UI logic from business logic, making the app more testable and maintainable.
- **Database:** **Room Persistence Library** - A database abstraction layer over SQLite that provides a fluent API and compile-time verification of SQL queries.
- **UI Components:**
  - **Material Design Components:** For a modern and consistent look and feel.
  - **RecyclerView:** For displaying the list of todo items efficiently.
  - **ViewModel:** To store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
  - **LiveData:** To build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- **Security:** **Android Keystore** or a standard encryption library (like **AES**) for password hashing and encryption.
